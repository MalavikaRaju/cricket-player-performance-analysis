# Cricket Player Performance Analysis 

## 📖 Project Overview
This project, **"Player Performance Analysis in Cricket"**, was developed as part of the **DAB 322 - Capstone Project 1** course at St. Clair College.  
It aims to create a **data-driven framework for evaluating cricket player performance** in the T20 format using **statistical analysis, machine learning models, and data visualization**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop a framework for assessing cricket player performance.
- Analyze key performance indicators (batting, bowling, fielding).
- Use advanced analytics & ML models for performance predictions.
- Build actionable insights for coaches, analysts, and selectors.
- Develop an interactive dashboard (Tableau).

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning** – Using ESPN Cricinfo datasets.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identifying trends & insights.  
3. **Model Building** – Regression & classification models for performance prediction.  
4. **Dashboard Development** – Tableau visualizations for better decision-making.  

## 🔑 Key Results
- Machine learning models showed promising accuracy in predicting player performance.
- Feature selection helped identify the most impactful performance metrics.
- Visualizations revealed insightful patterns in T20 cricket performance.
- Created a user-friendly dashboard for analysts and stakeholders.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
